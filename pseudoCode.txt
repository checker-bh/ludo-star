   - Create a function to check if a player has moved all pieces to the home area.
   - End the game if a player wins (moves all pieces to home).

5. Main Game Loop:

   - Inside the loop:

     - Clicking on the roll dice button.
     - Moving pieces based on game rules.

8. End Game:
   - Display a message when a player wins.
   - Provide option to restart the game.
