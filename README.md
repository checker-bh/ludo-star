1. **Choose Colors:** ðŸŽ¨ Each player picks a color and places their four pieces at the start of the board.

2. **Roll the Dice:** ðŸŽ² Roll the dice to decide who starts. The player with the highest number goes first, and play continues clockwise.

3. **Move Your Pieces:** ðŸš€ On your turn, roll the dice to move your pieces forward. The goal is to safely move all your pieces into your home area on the board.

4. **Strategy and Fun:** ðŸ”„ Players enjoy rolling the dice and using strategy. They might block opponents or send pieces back to the start, creating friendly competition.

> **Important Rule:** To start moving a piece from the starting area, a player must roll a 6. Once a 6 is rolled, the piece can enter the board and begin its journey. The player gets an extra turn whenever they roll a 6.


Ludo Star teaches counting, taking turns, and having fun with friends. It's great for two, three, or four players, perfect for gatherings and game nights.
